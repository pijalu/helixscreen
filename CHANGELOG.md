# Changelog

All notable changes to HelixScreen will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.99.35] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- Touch-friendly filament mapping: print-file details card shows a 2×2 grid of pills with the tool number (Tx) centered inside the gcode color dot; overflow past six tools collapses into a "+N" indicator. Mapping modal rows and slot-picker popup rows are taller, wider, and consistent with the same Tx-in-dot treatment.

### Fixed
- Settings → About: update modal reshows correctly after backdrop/ESC dismiss; DownloadStatus is reset before reopening.
- Updater: detect a wedged `/var/log` before launching install.sh; set `O_CLOEXEC` on the instance lock so post-install restart is not blocked.
- Restart: exec in-place instead of fork+exec to avoid a zombie race.
- Barcode scanner: AZERTY punctuation mapping corrected with a cross-layout regression test; BT pairing UX, keycode diagnostics, accent variant, reduced log noise.
- Bluetooth: register BlueZ `Agent1` so pairing completes into a real bond.
- Temperature graph: chamber series now shown for sensor-only (no thermistor) setups.
- Wi-Fi: require a live NetworkManager daemon before choosing the NM backend.
- Crash reports (AD5X / MIPS): surface the return-address register so MIPS backtraces resolve (prestonbrown/helixscreen#818).
- Bed mesh rendering: close a missed-wakeup race in the render thread's stop/request handshake.

### Changed
- Render performance: pre-blended card borders, 1:1 thumbnail blit, and camera FPS throttling cut per-frame CPU load.

## [0.99.34] - 2026-04-16

Hotfix for the v0.99.33 release: cross-compiled release bundles for every embedded platform (ad5m, ad5x, cc1, k1, k2, pi, pi32, snapmaker-u1, x86) shipped without `assets/config/`, causing "Could not load printer database" on first launch and breaking shipped themes, platform init hooks, print start profiles, and sound themes. v0.99.33 artifacts have been withdrawn.

### Fixed
- Release bundle omitted `assets/config/` seed tree — the refactor that split RO seeds out of `config/` updated `scripts/package.sh` but missed `mk/cross.mk`, which is the actual pipeline every embedded release uses. All `release-*` targets now ship `assets/config/printer_database.json`, `printing_tips.json`, `default_layout.json`, `helix_macros.cfg`, `themes/defaults/`, `presets/`, `print_start_profiles/`, `sounds/`, and `platform/hooks-*.sh`.

## [0.99.33] - 2026-04-16

Major Bluetooth reliability overhaul, new barcode scanner settings UI, first-run guided tour, HttpExecutor for bounded HTTP threading, responsive setting rows that collapse 7 micro/ XML variants, and a broad config refactor splitting read-only seed data from writable state.

### Added

- LVGL display anomaly section in stability dashboard
- Bluetooth HID scanner binding by MAC address with exclusive grab
- BT HID link verification after pairing with bond-refusal warning
- Bluetooth `enumerate_known` API for paired device listing
- `HELIX_CONFIG_DIR` and `HELIX_DATA_DIR` env vars for Yocto/read-only rootfs deployments

- Moonraker silent request mode — suppresses `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` events for background queries
- Cycling encouragement messages during long installs (#809)
- Responsive keyboard sizing with elevated keycaps and smart contrast text
- KIAUH extension shipped and registered on release installs

### Fixed

- Bluetooth: `thread_id_` race, submit TOCTOU, slot unref routing, `StartNotify` fallback guard
- Network: async backend init eliminates UI-thread blocking; self-join deadlock and ethernet thread pool fixes
- Exclude object: sync removals from Klipper status, drop stuck optimistic visuals on print end, silence spurious pre-print RPC timeouts
- Moonraker API callbacks guarded with lifetime tokens to prevent use-after-free
- Controls: segmented homing button bar on controls and micro controls panels
- Slider: responsive knob padding at tiny/micro breakpoints; fix overflow_visible attribute name
- Z-offset: compact format and wider temp icon gap at tiny breakpoint
- Camera: sleep callback token survives stream stop/start cycles
- Watchdog: bail out of restart loop on persistent failure instead of infinite retries
- Tour: re-target highlight on breakpoint change; cancel on navigation away from Home
- AMS: unlink external spool updates UI when previous filament color was black
- Scanner: dismiss progress toast on pair failure; wrap BT thread spawns in try/catch
- Label renderer: render negative spool IDs as 'TEST'
- Tool state: atomic write for `tool_spools.json` prevents corruption on crash
- API/camera: catch EAGAIN on `join_helper` thread spawn in destructors
- Print status idle card: micro breakpoint polish, subject-driven visibility
- Installer: prefer `/user-resource` for temp dir on CC1
- Help icon: resolve via responsive theme token
- Updater: 2min timeout extended for slow printers

### Changed
- Config layout: read-only seed configs moved to `assets/config/`, writable state stays in `config/`
- Bluetooth: D-Bus operations serialized through dedicated BusThread instead of ad-hoc thread spawns
- Power-device API calls migrated to HttpExecutor with tok.defer lifecycle safety
- Bluez detection uses pkg-config instead of compile-probe
- Yocto build support: `PLATFORM_TARGET=yocto` mode, bitbake LDFLAGS, Docker dev loop
