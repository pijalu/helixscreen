# HelixScreen User Guide

Your printer's touchscreen should show you more than temperatures and a progress bar. HelixScreen is a full-featured touch interface for Klipper printers that puts everything at your fingertips — things you'd normally need to open Mainsail or Fluidd for.

**What you get that other touchscreen UIs don't:**

- **A real dashboard** — Drag-and-drop widgets across multiple pages. Temperature graphs, fan controls, camera feeds, power toggles, favorite macros. You decide what's on screen, not the developer.
- **3D visualization** — Rotate your bed mesh with your finger. Preview G-code layers before printing. See input shaper frequency response charts right on the screen.
- **Multi-material that works** — AFC, Happy Hare, ACE, CFS, AD5X IFS, tool changers. Six backends, tested on real hardware. Per-unit dryer controls, environment monitoring, Spoolman integration.
- **Exclude objects** — Tap the failing part on an overhead map to exclude it mid-print. No more scrapping an entire plate for one bad object.
- **Runs on anything** — ~13MB of RAM, no X11, no browser, no desktop environment. Directly on the framebuffer. From a Creality K1 to a Pi Zero 2 W to a random mini-ITX box with an HDMI touchscreen.
- **Looks good** — 17 theme presets with a live editor, responsive layouts from 480x320 to ultrawide, GPU-accelerated blur. Light and dark modes.
- **Smart setup** — A first-run wizard auto-detects your printer from a database of 70+ models and configures everything. 9 languages.
